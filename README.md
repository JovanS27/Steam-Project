Proposal Project 4

Steam data sets

Steam Reviews

Steam Store Games (Clean dataset)

Steam Player Data

Steam Game Analysis

Using the data sets above we developed a few ideas for our project proposal : 

Kaggle dataset cleandata set Idea: Linking system requirement data with sales, reviews? 

Perhaps too difficult to parse the system requirements as they are not easily machine readable

Compare player numbers over time with news data? - keyword analysis or frequency analysis or both?
draw back, possibly unable to attain the data due to blocks, many of the users are ‘private’ users

Binary classification - find something (e.g. other games) that can predict positive or negative reviews for a particular game with over 75% certainty - kaggle/webscrape

Looking at the player reviews from steam for key words that are machine readable to predict game popularity.

From reviewed data set, look at unique user id and other features 

Formulate possible machine learning ideas from the steam.csv 

We are going to look at the above possibilities and decide on one after looking at the data we have.
